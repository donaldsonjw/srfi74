* SRFI 74: Octet-Addressed Binary Blocks 

** Description
   The srfi74 library is an implementation of [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-74/srfi-74.html][SRFI 74]] for Bigloo. It
   implements all of the defined functions and macros as well as a few
   extensions.

** Extensions

   * ~(blob #!rest bytes)~ :: construct a blob from the
        provided bytes (left to right).
   * ~(string->blob str)~ :: construct a blob from the
        provided string. The str is copied.
   * ~(string->blob! str)~ :: construct a blob from the
        provided string. The str is shared.
   * ~(blob-f32-ref blob index)~ :: returns the real encoded
        as a 32 bit float found in the blob at index.  
   * ~(blob-f32-set! blob index val)~ :: sets val as a 32 bit float in the blob at index.  
   * ~(blob-f64-ref blob index)~ :: returns the real encoded
        as a 64 bit float found in the blob at index.  
   * ~(blob-f64-set! blob index val)~ :: sets val as a 64 bit float in the blob at index.
